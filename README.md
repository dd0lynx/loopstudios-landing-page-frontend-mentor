## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) - Web Framwork

### Continued development

I want to work on writing more reuseable css and orginising my code to be more readable. I plan on revisiting this project to simplify the layout when i have a better understanding of using flexbox and grid and their uses.
